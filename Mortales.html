Subject: Assistance Required with Laptop Login Issue

Good Day CCD Department,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to seek your assistance with a recurring issue I am experiencing with my Infosys-issued laptop. I am encountering a discrepancy between the passwords for Windows login and Zscaler authentication. Specifically, after authenticating with Zscaler and then experiencing a system lock, I am unable to log back into Windows using the same credentials. This situation necessitates a system restart each time.

Additionally, I occasionally receive error messages indicating that the laptop is not recognized on the domain. Could you please assist me in resolving these issues? Your support would be greatly appreciated to ensure seamless access and functionality of my device.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your guidance and a resolution soon.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
