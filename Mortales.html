Good Day,

I hope this message finds you well. I am currently in the process of preparing my tax declaration and require the appropriate format for submission. As a holder of a Work Visa from Mexico and residing in the U.S., I wish to ensure that my tax obligations are met accurately.

My accountant has informed me that your office provides the necessary documentation for this purpose. Could you please assist me in obtaining the correct format? Your guidance will be greatly appreciated in facilitating my compliance with tax regulations.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,
